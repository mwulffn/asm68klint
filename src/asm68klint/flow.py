"""Follow a routine's code and track which registers hold their entry value.

The analysis walks every path through the routine. Along the way it keeps a
``State``: the set of registers whose value may differ from the one they had on
entry (the dirty registers), and a model of what the routine has pushed on the
stack. A register saved with a long push while it is still clean and popped
back later is clean again, which is how saved and restored registers count as
preserved.
